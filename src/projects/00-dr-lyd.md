I am the lead software engineer on the Danish Broadcasting Corporation's **[DR&nbsp;Lyd](https://www.dr.dk/lyd)**, the website on which you can listen to live radio and podcasts. I oversaw and executed a transition from the previous older website to **a modern Next.js/React-powered stack** that integrated well with the rest of the organization's technology.

I authored nearly every line of code in the project: Interface code, audio/video player code, and a Node backend with integrations towards our APIs. Its success and stability made it the **first of many Next.js solutions** in the company. The product is key to the company mission in a space that is increasingly saturated by big budget competitors.

As part of the project, we brought on a junior software engineer that I am a mentor for. It's been a joy to help develop internal talent, communicating central ideas such as modularizations, debuggability and reusability.

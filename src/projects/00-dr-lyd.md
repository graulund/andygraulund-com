I am the lead software engineer on the Danish Broadcasting Corporation's **[DR&nbsp;Lyd](https://www.dr.dk/lyd)**, the website on which you can listen to live radio and podcast episodes. I oversaw and executed a transition from the previous older website to a modern Next.js/React-powered stack that **integrated well with the rest of the organization's technology.** I also implemented a custom HLS.js player used in the project.

I was an integral part of every technical decision as part of the project, from the very beginning to where it is today. It was a trailblazer; its success and stability made it the **first of many Next.js solutions** in the company. A large-scale combination of interface code, audio/video player code, a Node backend with deep integrations towards the rest of the organization, it was arguably one of the **most complex technical initiatives** driven by a single person within the company.

The success of the product created highly satisfied users, increased performance and reliability, and was key to the company mission in a space that is increasingly saturated by big budget competitors.

During this project, I was part of the process of hiring a junior software engineer and bringing them onto the team. It's been a joy to **help develop internal talent** and growing another engineer, communicating central ideas such as modularizations, debuggability and reusability.

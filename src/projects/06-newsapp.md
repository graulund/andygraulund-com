## I played a vital part in developing one of Denmark's most downloaded news reading apps

<p class="meta">2016–2019</p>

In 2016–2017, I was one of two software engineers responsible for the development of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation's news reading app, which was a single page React web application in (a convincing) disguise as a native app — and the **first time React was used in the organization at all.** Then a bold technological choice that since set the standard across the company. In the early stages, I was a major factor in deciding the technological stack of the app, which was in use for 6 years.

I was **instrumental in the communications** between web engineering and the native iOS and Android developers on the project. This allowed us to work tightly together and design a shared API that in turn allowed the app to look and feel native on both platforms, even though a large part of it was web based. This saved the organization a lot of hassle, since we could achieve more with less.

The app was consistently **among the most downloaded apps** in the "News" category on the App Store in Denmark.<br style="clear:right" />

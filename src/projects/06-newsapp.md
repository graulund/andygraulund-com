## I played a vital part in developing one of Denmark's most downloaded news reading apps

I was one of two software engineers responsible for the development of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation's news app, which was a single page React web application in (a convincing) disguise as a native app — and the **first time React was used in the organization at all.** I was a major factor in deciding the technological stack of the app, which was in use for 6 years.

This effort required close collaboration with the external native iOS and Android developers on the project. Together, we designed a shared API that allowed the app to look and feel native on both platforms, despite the web based nature of the stack. This saved the organization a lot of hassle, since we could achieve more with less.

The app was consistently **among the most downloaded apps** in the "News" category on the App Store in Denmark.

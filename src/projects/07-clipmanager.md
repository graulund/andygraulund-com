## When I was in university radio, I created software to help the workflow

A major challenge, but nonetheless very exciting: I worked with MIDI hardware, and developed a **native app for Mac in Swift and Windows in C#.** I taught myself brand new things in service of solving an important problem: The instant playing of sound effects in shows at the university radio station.

All existing solutions were either sub-par or prohibitively expensive. With a little handiwork, the best solution was created. Drag a sound to a button in the software, and tap that button, and the sound was instantly played. The hardware button lights up as long as the sound is still playing. <!-- The resulting audio was being sent to its own channel on the mixer, allowing the studio engineer to set the volume level as fit. --> **MIDI signals, audio interfaces and drag events.** Hardware and software working together as one. <br style="clear:left" />

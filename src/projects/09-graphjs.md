Even with my heavy algorithmic educational background from university, I was fascinated by the connection between human and computer. My bachelor's thesis project was a **web application that aided humans in the creation of algorithmic graphs** and the execution of algorithms on resulting graphs. A project using JavaScript and the then new <code>canvas</code> element.

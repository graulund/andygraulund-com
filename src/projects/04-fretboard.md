## When I wanted to learn guitar, I created a virtual annotated fretboard

I wanted to learn the guitar, but the fretboard on a guitar is pretty daunting to someone new â€” so many places where you can place your fingertip, and not be aware exactly what's going to happen. As someone who already knows a bit of music theory, I was curious exactly how the various pitches mapped onto the fretboard.

So I created my own interactive visualization in React; it shows all the pitches laid out, and allows you to select a key, highlighting the points on the fretboard containing pitches only present in this musical key.

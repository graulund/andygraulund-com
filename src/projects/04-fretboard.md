## When I wanted to learn guitar, I created a virtual annotated fretboard

I wanted to learn the guitar. I made [my own interactive visualization of a guitar fretboard](https://andygraulund.com/fretboard/) in React; it shows all the pitches laid out, and allows you to select a key, highlighting the points on the fretboard containing pitches that are only present in the selected musical key. Feel free to play with the interactive demo above!

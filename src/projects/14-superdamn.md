The most advanced piece of JavaScript code I had ever made as a teenager. A full fletched application that required the proper organization of code. A project that **solved a big amount of problems all at once,** that many chatters on DeviantArt were then facing. Enlisting friends for many contributions and putting it all together. Countless downloads to the point that **nearly every chatter was using it.** My first experience releasing code to a _lot_ of people.

After that, I ended up getting a gig as a remote interface designer for DeviantArt, one of my favorite websites at the time.

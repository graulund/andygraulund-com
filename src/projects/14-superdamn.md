## I created a most used browser plugin for DeviantArt chatters in my free time, and ended up with a job

<p class="meta">2009</p>

The most advanced piece of JavaScript code I had ever made as a teenager. A full fletched application that required the proper organization of code. A project that **solved a big amount of problems all at once,** that many chatters on DeviantArt were then facing. Enlisting friends for many contributions and putting it all together. **Countless downloads** to the point that nearly every chatter was using it.

After that, I ended up getting a gig as a remote interface designer for DeviantArt.

## For a side project, I created my own simple area charting library focused on aesthetics

<figure style="width: 60rem; margin-right: -12rem">
	<div class="andy-chart-root">
		<noscript>Here is an area chart. Turn on JavaScript to see the chart</noscript>
	</div>
	<figcaption>Demo: This shows the number of times tracks by The Weekend were played on a major Danish radio channel per day in winter 2021. <strong>Move your mouse over the titles to highlight a specific track</strong></figcaption>
</figure>

In order to display a visualization of the amount of times per day a song is played, I created my own simple charting framework that creates area charts. While there's already an enormous amount of JavaScript charting frameworks out there, I had a hard time finding one that did exactly what I wanted to, and wasn't overly complicated. So I made my own tiny framework in TypeScript, React and SVG. **Small, sleek, to the point.**

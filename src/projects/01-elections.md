One of the most critical missions of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation is the coverage of national elections. The **communication of democracy** needs to be clear and effective. That's why I'm honored to have been part of this vital product for several elections.

Initially I was tasked to build an internal interface that allows TV producers to **inspect, choose, and queue results to be displayed on the TV signal.** A critical component that communicated with many different systems and was integral to the efficiency of the TV production.

As the elections passed, my work moved from the production room to front and center on the TV screen. I had the lead engineering role in creating a **touch screen interface used in the TV show** by election experts to convey results. This was a large-scale effort that required tight collaboration with the content teams and design teams, integration with sometimes highly experimental hardware, along with deep UX understanding, in order to create a product that allowed the on-screen personalities to communicate effortlessly at every stage of the election night.

In the later years, I transitioned from a hands-on role to a **directing role**, overseeing a team of engineers refine the product and add new features, with the team relying on me as a communication pathway with stakeholders.

The election night TV coverages were regularly highly praised, and the latest one peaked at [over 700,000 viewers](https://www.dr.dk/om-dr/nyheder/drs-valgdaekning-er-blevet-fulgt-flittigt-og-25-millioner-har-nu-taget-kandidattesten) at a moment the exit poll was revealed â€” something that was done using our technology.

I developed a stats tracker for music being played on Danish radio channels in my free time — mainly because I was curious about the numbers. A very advanced project for me back in the day: Full stack, backend, database work, with many queries from various angles **making sense of an increasing amount of big data.** Other people were curious, too: The project is visited by many in the Danish recording industry to this day.

## When Twitter was limiting your ability to see your own old tweets, I created an open source tweet archiving tool called Tweet Nest

Apparently, I have always been into archiving online data in a presentable manner. When I was a late teen, I created Tweet Nest: A response to Twitter limiting your visible tweet history to the latest 3,200 tweets. Back then, there was enough outcry about it that it came to my attention, and given that I love archiving online data, I created this tool from PHP that used a MySQL database and **connected to the Twitter API to download your tweets into your own database.**

After that, these tweets were easily displayed, with a page for each month of tweets, allowing easy access to your Twitter past. **I then built the marketing to promote this project,** and it took on a life of its own. It was highly popular in some circles, and was mentioned on Lifehacker.

Involving database designing, creating API calling code, backend code, frontend code, designing, documenting, and marketing, I made a truly **multifaceted piece of work.**

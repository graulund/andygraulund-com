## When Twitter was limiting your ability to see your own old tweets, I created an open source tweet archiving tool called Tweet Nest

When I was a late teen, Twitter started limiting your visible tweet history on their site. There was enough outcry about it that it came to my attention, and I created this tool with PHP which **connects to the Twitter API to download your tweets into a database you control.** After that, the project displays your tweets, with a page for each month of tweets, allowing easy access to your Twitter past.

The project took on a life of its own. It was highly popular in some circles, and was mentioned on Lifehacker. I was a one-man army on the project: I structured the database, coded, designed, created detailed documentation and elaborate marketing.

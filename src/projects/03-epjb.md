## As part of my Twitch streaming hobby, I devised a web app that communicates with APIs to create a seamless game queueing experience

During the covid pandemic, I became a live streamer on Twitch. I played _community games_; video games meant for viewers to join. Unfortunately, there are limited spots for viewers to join.

To solve the issue, I created a very integrated, intuitive queueing system using Node.js/React/WebSockets which interfaces with Twitch's APIs. Once you are at the front of the queue, the application **automatically gives you access to the game.**

Everything became much more smooth, and this elevated the viewing experience vastly. <br style="clear:left" />

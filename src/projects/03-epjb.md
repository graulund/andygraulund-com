## As part of my Twitch streaming hobby, I devised a web app that communicates with APIs to create a seemless game queueing experience

<p class="meta">2021</p>

During the covid pandemic, I became a live streamer on Twitch. I played _community games_; video games meant for viewers to join. Unfortunately, there are limited spots for viewers to join.

<!-- On other community game streams, getting a spot is often a first come first serve kind of situation, which creates chaos. -->

To solve the issue, I created a Node.js/React/WebSockets project that connects to Twitch's API (REST and PubSub), and serves as a very integrated, intuitive queueing system. Once you are at the front of the queue, the application **automatically gives you access to the game.**

Everything became much more smooth, which elevated the viewing experience vastly, and I once again felt the joy I feel when software — relatively invisibly — solves a problem so well. <br style="clear:left" />

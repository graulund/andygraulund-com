Stayed in Zurich, Switzerland for three months over the summer as an **UI design intern on the Google Flights Search team.** I did many visual mockups for potential site features, along with a lot of idea generation. First experiences navigating in a really big organization. I worked with a UI designer as mentor, and had some of my ideas go live in production, for millions of eyeballs to see.

## At my first job as a teenager, I created a digital system to speed up customer service

<p class="meta">2009</p>

The earliest example of me going above and beyond and thinking creatively to solve problems. At my first job, I was in retail IT customer service. Computers that needed support were flying in. But keeping track of support cases was messy: Handwritten notes strewn everywhere. Little to no control over which computer belonged to which case.

I set up a spare computer and **wrote a quick and easy digital case tracking system** that everyone started using â€” and everything became vastly more orderly.

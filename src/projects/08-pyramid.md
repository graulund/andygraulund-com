## I created a feature-rich full stack Node/React IRC client with Twitch emote support

<!-- I've been hanging out a lot on the live streaming website Twitch over the years. I've gained a big group of friends I got to know over the website. Chatting in Twitch chat is a way I've done a lot of socialization.

But I wanted to keep the connection going even when I wasn't viewing a live stream with friends. -->

A free-time project: A browser-based chatting client for use with [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/) — with support for unique Twitch features like username colors and emotes. A Node.js, React, WebSockets and Electron project, it was an enormous undertaking, and a **great learning experience** — at some point I even hosted it as a service. <br style="clear:right" />

I'm pretty extroverted compared to a stereotypical engineer. I see myself as the local _fun guy_. I like to brighten people's days. And I like to talk â€” I've been a host of several podcasts and radio shows, in addition to live streams on Twitch.

I like to chase dreams. After hard work on the side for many years, I had a stint as a professional radio host on the national level.

I really really _really_ like music. I can go on about it forever. I also dig fitness, wellness, and audio engineering. Also: Design, art, bicycling, public transit, architecture, espresso, and music theory.

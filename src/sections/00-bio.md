Hi! I’m Andy! I basically grew up with the internet, and have been doing web development since I was a teen. I’m very passionate about code and design coming together. And I love making useful things.

* 10+ years of web development and experience, specializing in frontend and UI
* Extensive design and UX experience
* Worked on products that have been seen and used by hundreds of thousands of people
* Very independent, highly solution oriented, and highly motivated

Currently at the Danish National Broadcasting Corporation (DR) — previously at Google, DeviantArt among others

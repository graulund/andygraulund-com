I'm pretty extroverted compared to a stereotypical developer. I see myself as the local _fun guy_. I like to brighten people's days. And I like to talk â€” I've been a host of several podcasts and radio shows.

I really really _really_ like music. I can go on about it forever. I also dig fitness, wellness, and audio engineering. Also: Design, art, bicycling, public transit, architecture, espresso, and music theory.

### Frontend Web Developer at the Danish National Broadcasting Corporation (DR)

<p class="meta">2015–present, Copenhagen</p>

I made a big impact in the organization over a longer period, working on many different projects — each reaching a large percentage of the Danish population. Often working in a senior role, I regularly make impactful technical decisions.

I am the lead frontend developer on **[DR&nbsp;Lyd](https://www.dr.dk/lyd)**, the website on which you can listen to live radio and podcast episodes. I oversaw — and executed — a transition from the previous older website to a modern Next.js/React-powered stack that integrated well with the rest of the organization's technology. I also implemented a custom HLS.js player used in the project. It was a trailblazer; its success and stability made it the first of many Next.js solutions in the company.

Over the years, I became a main force in developing technology for visualizing and communicating **results of national elections and referendums in Denmark** through the use of a frontend React stack in a novel way: Creating solutions made specifically for the hosts in the studio; interactive results communication tools. We were tightly integrated with sometimes experimental hardware, and on multiple occasions, I was tech lead for several developers working on the product.

In 2016–2017, I was one of two frontend developers responsible for the development of the **[DR&nbsp;News&nbsp;app for iOS and Android](https://apps.apple.com/dk/app/dr-nyheder/id398346158)**, which was a React frontend web stack in (a convincing) disguise as a native app — and the first time React was used in the organization at all. In the early stages, I was a major factor in deciding the technological stack of the app, which is still in use today.
